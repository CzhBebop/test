In the ModificationExcerpts.pdf, we have included selected modified sections with the modifications indicated in red font. 

In order to help readers better understand the article, we have added two illustrative figures, 
one explaining the decomposition process of the total correlation and 
the other explaining the relationship between the granularity of disentangling and model expression. 

Additionally, we have conducted more disentangling comparison experiments in our study, 
including unsupervised disentangling comparisons with contrlVAE, GuideVAE, disco, and HFVAE on multiple training sets. 

Furthermore, compared to the original paper that only used the MIG metric, the new comparative experiments were conducted under multiple recognized disentangling metrics(Factor, Sap ,Mig).
