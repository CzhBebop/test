In the ModificationExcerpts.pdf, we have included selected modified sections with the modifications indicated in red font. 

In order to help readers better understand the article, we have added two illustrative figures, 
Fig1 explains the decomposition process of the total correlation,
Fig2 explains the relationship between the granularity of disentangling and model expression. 

Additionally, we have conducted more disentangling comparison experiments in our study, 
including unsupervised disentangling comparisons with contrlVAE, GuideVAE, disco, and HFVAE on multiple training sets. 

Furthermore, compared to the original paper that only used the MIG metric, the new comparative experiments were conducted under multiple recognized disentangling metrics(Factor, Sap ,Mig).
